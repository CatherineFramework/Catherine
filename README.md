## Install
Installing Catherine is easy, all you have to do is run the installer and you're good to go!

First, make sure the installer is setup as an executable:
```bash
chmod +x Catherine_Installer
```

Now run the installation script:
```bash
./Catherine_Installer
```

If you have cURL installed, feel free to run the installer this way:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hifumitech/catherine/main/Catherine_Installer | bash
```

Already have Catherine modules installed? Run the installer again to update the modules!

## Issues
If you are unable to run the installation script on WSL, try running these commands:
```bash
chmod +x Catherine_Installer
```

```bash
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' Catherine_Installer
```
